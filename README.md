# CS-370-SNHU

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  For this project I was provided with startup code for TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py. I completed the reinforced learning algorithm for our pirate agent. I also created the game loops using Keras and Tensorflow for pathfinding.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists work to solve complex problems through the use of technology and code. For example, in this course I learned to use reinforced learning to solve a complex game.
  
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  I must approach problems with a technical mindset and consider the technological ways I can solve problems that are presented.
  
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  From this course I learned how big of a concern bias can be in AI. We must be constantly aware of what we are creating and what data we are using to teach AI as to avoid any ethical problems that could arise. Hidden bias in AI can cause problems for companies and individuals if not handled seriously.
